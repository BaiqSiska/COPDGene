\section{Skewed Variables in Backward Search}
The feature list obtained from backward search is not ideal in that features such as `FRCpred\_race\_adjusted',`TLCpred\_race\_adjusted',`Height' are kept till last. We suspect these might be the so-called skewed variables, which could result in imbalanced clusters. We need to test if our hypothesis is true by looking at sample labels by clustering using those features.

It seems that clusters are quite balanced.
