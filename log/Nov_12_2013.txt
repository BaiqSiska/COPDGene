As Pete suggested, do the following:

1, Rerun the analysis using the updated features, which is described in 
ExperimentResults/FeatureSelection/features_included_info_mhc20131104.txt.

2, Change supervision in forward search: include 'FEV1pp_utah' and
'pctEmph_Slicer' before running forward search.

3, Justify the choice of this GAP metric.

4, How to automatically select the number of clusters K?


For 1 and 2, I do the following:
Step 1: Extract feature annotation information from
features_included_info_mhc_20131104.txt;
Step 2: Run the following four experiment
    2.1) Forward search with supervision "FEV1pp_utah" and "FEV1_FVC_utah";
    2.2) Forward search with supervision "FEV1pp_utah" and "pctEmph_Slicer";
    2.3) Forward search with GAP(No supervsion);
    2.4) Backward search with GAP(No supervision);

For 4, how to determine the number of clusters from the data, try:
    4.1) Run DPGMM+Supervision('FEV1pp_utah' and 'FEV1_FVC_utah');
    4.2) Run DPGMM+Supervision('FEV1pp_utah' and 'pctEmph_Slicer');
